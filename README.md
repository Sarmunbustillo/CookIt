# CookIt!
UPDATE -- the free api i used is no longer working, i will change it soon! so the app is not momentarily working but the code is still there 

Recipe finder, just search and the results will appear. 

Features:
 -possible to change the servings amount, the ingredients will dynamically increase or decrease respectively.
 -add the ingredients to your shopping cart, also there manipulate the quantity or simply eliminate them.
 -like the recipes you want to save and check them later.
 
 
 I use a free API that only allows a certain amount of uses per day, so if you get the 'error proccessing the recipe" means that the limit has been reached and just gotta wait a day! SORRY about that :(!
